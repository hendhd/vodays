This little hack parses GAVO Heidelberg's list of VO days (which is
kept in a wiki page, URL cf. mkmap.py) and turns it into geojson.

That, when committed to github, can be viewed as a nice map.  See docs at
https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/ and
http://www.geojson.org/geojson-spec.html

The map's URL is 
https://github.com/msdemlei/vodays/blob/master/gavo_vo_days.geojson

Updating:

$ git pull
$ ./mkmap.py
(possibly investiage warnings/error)
$ git commit -a -m "Updating from upstream map"
$ git push

(reload URL)
